## PWRTelegram messenger for Android

[PWRTelegram](https://pwrtelegram.xyz/pwrtelegram-app) is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple and free.
This repo contains the official source code for the [PWRTelegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.pwrtelegram.messenger).

Also do check out the [PWRTelegram bot API: a boosted version of telegram's bot API that can upload/download files up to 1.5 GB, supports anonymous downloads and much more!](https://pwrtelegram.xyz).  

The PWRTelegram app is a fork of the official Telegram messenger app that can login as a bot.  
You just need to provide the bot token and you will be able to receive all of the messages your bot receives or sends to its groups or users.  
Once you login you won’t get a dialog list, but when a user sends you a message it will be received and the chat will be created.  
This app is still in beta state, if you notice any bug report it to the [official PWRTelegram group](https://telegram.me/pwrtelegamgroup) by sending an accurate description of the problem with the logs (settings->send logs).
