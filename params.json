It’s superfast, simple and free.\r\nThis repo contains the official source code for the [PWRTelegram App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.pwrtelegram.messenger).\r\n\r\nAlso do check out the [PWRTelegram bot API: a boosted version of telegram's bot API that can upload/download files up to 1.5 GB, supports anonymous downloads and much more!](https://pwrtelegram.xyz).  \r\n\r\nThe PWRTelegram app is a fork of the official Telegram messenger app that can login as a bot.  \r\nYou just need to provide the bot token and you will be able to receive all of the messages your bot receives or sends to its groups or users.  \r\nThe app will login to the MTProto API, just like normal telegram clients. This way you will still be able to receive updates from your bot.  \r\nOnce you login you won’t get a dialog list, but when a user sends you a message it will be received and the chat will be created.  \r\nThis app is still in beta state, if you notice any bug report it to the [official PWRTelegram group](https://telegram.me/pwrtelegamgroup) by sending an accurate description of the problem with the logs (settings->send logs).  \r\n\r\nThis app was modified by [Daniil Gentili](https://daniil.it).",
