This way you will still be able to receive updates from your bot.  \r\nOnce you login you wonâ€™t get a dialog list, but when a user sends you a message it will be received and the chat will be created.  \r\nThis app is still in beta state, if you notice any bug report it to the [official PWRTelegram group](https://telegram.me/pwrtelegamgroup) by sending an accurate description of the problem.  \r\n\r\nTo access deep telegram bots you just need to click on settings->switch backend.\r\n\r\nAlso do check out the [PWRTelegram bot API: a boosted version of telegram's bot API that can upload/download files up to 1.5 GB, supports anonymous downloads and much more!](https://pwrtelegram.xyz).  \r\n\r\nThis app was modified by [Daniil Gentili](https://daniil.it).\r\n",
